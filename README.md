Various scripts for USB HID, RFID, RF, and other physical attacks

ftp-revshell is a DuckyScript that will gather most good WinPC info/loot that you need to penetrate, lateral, or otherwise know more information about your target. It takes this 'loot' and uploads it to the file server of your choice on line # , and it also creates a reverse shell to the remote listener of your choice on line # on port 8080.
